This bug occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook with a large amount of data.  The hook throws an error, which may not be immediately apparent from the error message.  The issue stems from the underlying AsyncStorage limitations on the amount of data that can be stored at once.  Trying to store a large JSON object, or even a large string exceeding the storage limit, leads to unexpected behavior.
